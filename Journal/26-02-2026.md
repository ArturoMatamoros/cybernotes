### Log 
- [[PEN testing]] 
	- Rule n. 1 : always write everything. Many carreers ended because of the lack of writing. 
	- here we study some [[python]] script for [[Arp spoofing]]
	-  [[spoof_arp]] 
- reading the first chapters of [[Linux basics for hackers]]
- reading and writing the first chapters of [[Automate the boring stuff with python]] 
	- the objective of this is to read the first half of the book just to have the necessary tools to move onto something more in line with cybersecurity. 
- The first chapters, since I have studied all these concepts previously, are fastly skimmed with a strong focus of solving the problems at the end of the chapter.
